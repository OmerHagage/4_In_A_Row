AI description: in each turn of connect 4, there are a maximum of 7
possible places to make your turn. Because of this limited number of options,
we decided to check all of the options, and grade them according to their
efficiency. we added points for adding a disc in a central place, and for
creating sequences of disks, or stopping the opponent from creating sequences.
likewise, we deducted points for enabling our opponent to create sequences.
thus, we found the best possible option for adding a disk each turn, and played
that way. We decided on a defensive approach, giving emphasis on blocking our
opponent as much as we can of creating sequences of three disks, and meanwhile
creating as many sequences of our own as we can, and that way trying to ensure
a win.
